### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was a favorite because it was the first program I have ever "created," and it will be a memory that will remain with me for life. In addition, I was able to, for the first time, instruct the computer so that it would print "Hello World" on the computer's screen. Furthermore, it also helped me become familiar with Git, GitHub & GitHub Classroom.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2 was a favorite because I had always wanted to know how to make a program that asked for someone's input in order for me to use that input on my program. In addition, I was able to read and store the computer user's input text from the keyboard in my program. In the end, I was able to use the stored input of the user to create a paragraph of text similar to the comedy word game Mad Libs.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was a favorite because I have always been intrigued to know how someone can create an animation on a computer's screen. I was able to make use of functions, classes, and an external C++ library in my program to combine images into a GIF. In the end, the program created a beautiful, animated gradient.
